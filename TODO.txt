redo mappings according to the following layout:
    ma = local scroll position
    mA = global scroll position
    Ma = mini-book*marks* that jump to pages by character/key
    MA = same as above but with scroll position
    and add ma and mA mappings to pointer mode, which store the xy position local/global
    (where a/A can be any character and represents unshifted vs shifted keys)
    the marks are loaded using ' and "
make 2 settings for local vs global mark behavior (current, newtab, matching, splits) for where to load the mark
add help documentation
